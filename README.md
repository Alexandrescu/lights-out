Lights Out
========================

Lights out is a Preference Pane that automatically changes the OS X Yosemite to dark theme at night and light theme during the day.

If you'd like to help out, clone the repository, make some changes and issue a pull request.

This is a work in progress and doesn't work 100% just yet - please don't try to build and install the prefPane yourself unless you're contributing to the project. I'll release just the prefPane for easy install when it's ready.

I'll post updates on Twitter - [@rheotron](http://twitter.com/rheotron).
