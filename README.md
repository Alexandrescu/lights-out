Lights Out
========================

Lights Out is a Preference Pane that automatically changes the OS X Yosemite to dark theme at night and light theme during the day.

If you'd like to help out, clone the repository, make some changes and issue a pull request.

This is a work in progress and doesn't work 100% just yet - please don't try to build and install the prefPane yourself unless you're contributing to the project. I'll release just the prefPane for easy install when it's ready.

### Features
- Enter the time of day you want the dark theme to turn on and turn off.
- Lives in a simple PrefPane that doesn't clutter your menu bar or dock.
  
### Coming Soon...
- Fancy UI and pretty icons.
- Use your location to determine sunrise and sunset times and use these to change the theme.
- Better and more efficient process to check the time (needs more investigation)


If you want to keep up to date I'll post about the project regularly on Twitter - [@rheotron](http://twitter.com/rheotron).
