OS X Dark Theme Automator
========================

Automatically changes the OS X Yosemite to dark theme at night and light theme during the day.

As it stands this is going to work as a PrefPane that will allow users to input their desired time to change to dark mode. 

If you'd like to help out, clone the repository, make some changes and issue a pull request.

This doesnt' work yet - please don't try to build and install the prefPane yourself unless you're contributing to the project. I'll release just the prefPane for easy install when it's ready.

I'll post updates on Twitter - [@rheotron](http://twitter.com/rheotron).
